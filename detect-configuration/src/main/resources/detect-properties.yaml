  additionalGroups:

  help: A comma-separated list of directory name patterns for which Detect searches
    and adds to the signature scanner --exclude flag values.
  helpDetailed: These patterns are file system glob patterns ('?' is a wildcard for
    a single character, '*' is a wildcard for zero or more characters). Detect will
    recursively search within the scan targets for files/directories that match these
    patterns and will create the corresponding exclusion patterns (paths relative
    to the scan target directory) for the signature scanner (Black Duck scan CLI).
    Please note that the signature scanner will only exclude directories; matched
    filenames will be passed to the signature scanner but will have no effect. These
    patterns will be added to the patterns provided by detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.exclusion.patterns
    and passed as --exclude values. Use this property when you want Detect to convert
    the given patterns to actual paths. Use detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.exclusion.patterns
    to pass patterns directly to the signature scanner as-is.
